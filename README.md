## Homework objective:
The aim of this homework was to write some important algorithms and their visualizations by ourselves. The homework is divided into four functions:

 **Functionality 1 - Find the Neighbours:** 

 - where we used the bfs algorithm to find all the nodes at the given distance  

 **Functionality 2 - Find the smartest Network:** 
  - The function find_smartest receives two parameteres, first the list of nodes that must be passed. Then the type of weight that should be considered for analysis. ed_t, ed_d, ed_1 which respectively stand fortime, distance and edges weghted 1.

 **Functionality 3 - Shortest Ordered Route:** 

 - graphT: generate the travel time graph,
 - graphDB: generates the distance graph,
 - createPath: generates the best path recalling the order function richiamando
 - order: is a sort of bfs algo

 **Functionality 4 - Shortest Route:** 
 - (look at the function 3)
 - fun4:take in input any kind of graph and make a new output using createGrah.

 ## Repository structure:
 
 **main.py**   - take in input an integer (from 1 to 4), that corresponds to the funcions.
 
 **func_1.py** - Find the Neighbours
 
 **func_2.py** - Find the smartest Network
 
 **func_3.py** - Shortest Ordered Route
 
 **func_4.py** - Shortest Route
